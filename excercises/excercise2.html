        <p>Mount Kailash, located in the remote western Tibet, is considered one of the most sacred mountains in the
            world. Standing at 6,638 meters, it holds profound religious significance for Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and
            followers of Bon religion. The mountain is believed to be the abode of Lord Shiva in Hindu tradition. Its
            distinctive pyramid-like shape and the challenging pilgrimage route around it (known as Kailash Kora)
            attract thousands of devotees annually. The mountain remains unclimbed out of respect for its religious
            importance.</p>

        <p>Mount Everest, known as Sagarmatha in Nepali and Chomolungma in Tibetan, stands as the world's highest peak
            at 8,848.86 meters. Located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas, it straddles the border
            between Nepal and Tibet. The mountain has captured human imagination for decades, with Sir Edmund Hillary
            and Tenzing Norgay being the first to reach its summit in 1953. The Everest region is home to the Sherpa
            people and features the famous Everest Base Camp trek, one of the most popular high-altitude treks in the
            world.</p>

        <p>Kanchenjunga, meaning "Five Treasures of Snow," is the third highest mountain in the world at 8,586 meters.
            Located on the border between Nepal and the Indian state of Sikkim, this majestic peak consists of five
            distinct summits. The mountain holds special significance for the people of Sikkim and Darjeeling, who
            consider it sacred. Kanchenjunga National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, surrounds the mountain and
            protects diverse flora and fauna including the elusive snow leopard. The mountain's beauty has inspired
            countless poets and artists over the centuries.</p>

            alt="mount nilgiris">
        <p>The Nilgiri Hills, meaning "blue mountains," are located in the Western Ghats where Tamil Nadu, Karnataka,
            and Kerala meet. Famous for tea plantations and the hill station of Ooty (Udhagamandalam), the Nilgiris are
            known for their pleasant climate year-round. The region is home to the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, which
            protects endangered species like the Nilgiri Tahr. The iconic Nilgiri Mountain Railway, a UNESCO World
            Heritage Site, connects the hills to the plains below. The area is also known for its eucalyptus forests,
            botanical gardens, and the indigenous Toda people with their unique culture.</p>

            alt="mount aravalli">
        <p>The Aravalli Range is one of the oldest mountain ranges in India, stretching from Gujarat through Rajasthan
            to Delhi. Despite being ancient and weathered, with Mount Abu as its highest peak at 1,722 meters, the
            Aravallis play a vital role in preventing the Thar Desert from spreading eastward. The range is known for
            its marble quarries in Rajasthan and houses the famous Dilwara Temples of Mount Abu. These mountains are
            rich in mineral resources and have been historically significant for mining activities. The Aravallis also
            support unique wildlife sanctuaries and have been crucial in shaping the climate of northwestern India.</p>
